fix with:

❯ 01 ignore Floflis\ ISO/Floflis\ ppl/
/usr/bin/01: 17: [: ./Floflis: unexpected operator
[!] Failure on ignoring file/folder. 'Floflis ISO/Floflis ppl/' isn't here. Please ensure you wrote the correct path/name.

- know when it is a folder/file when ignoring

01 init kick
x="init"
export x
git $x
git add .
git commit -m "$x"

- store files' dates (soon)

- install IPFS which should be built-in (would need Plugz)

- keep using sh instead of bash
- import git
- preference for gitty

merge pijul VCS if it mets the following criteria:
- can decompress the db into individual objects, like git unpack
- objects are compatible with git, for unique files for use in IPFS
- git projects can easily be ported to it, and else. a project can have the same repo both in git and pijul, and make them in sync
then, rename gitty to 01, while also having backwards compatibility with git

Gitty also haves a repo. clone with

support recursive flag

updates

gitty udf - bare git (or different git folders) in disc as remote

git checkout -f HEAD

README.md
* Rely primarily on gitless, install git as option
* Can resume git clone/sync, like torrent (DHT instead of HTTP), without worries about network resets; also avoids MiTM attacks
* Blockchain-like, with a P2P ledger of blobs/modifications (IPFS' IPNS)
------------------------------
on install: rename "git" as "gitish", install itself as "git", also having the "gitty" exec
install git-unpack as lib, support its command
node/dat as comments in recipe.json; add git binaries, add go/IPFS
