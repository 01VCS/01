Git/Pijul, on steroids üöÄ

01 VCS is a suite of improvements for current VCS' such as git; and can be considered itself as a (layer 2) VCS.

In my tests, I'm still using 01's git wrapper where even the bugs (such as escaping quotes) works as features/improvements, by just using the usual "git" command.

Its also slowly replacing git's perl functions into Rust!

Awesome commands:

- '01 size' (Shows size of git repository. '-q' for quiet simpler output)
- '01/git ignore <file/folder>' (Adds a file/folder to the .gitignore file, and git will not track it.)
- '01 blm' (Migrate from 'master' to 'main' branch in a repo ‚úäüèø)

Awesome commands for our git wrapper:

- 'git init' (with 01, now it uses Rust)
- 'git add -r <file/extension>' (Add files/extensions recursively! Only one file per once.)
- 'git unstage' (Tell what files you want to unstage/not to include in the next commit.)

# Installing

Open terminal on Gitty folder, and type following by pressing `[ENTER]`:

```sh
chmod +x install.sh && sh ./install.sh
```

01 is already a minimum viable product; but PRs and issues are welcome!

Alongside community contributions, the maintainer of this project will try to find time to keep updating 01, although she does already have a ton of projects to manage (con)currently.
